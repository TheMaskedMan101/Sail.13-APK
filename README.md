# Sail.13-APK

Sail.13-APK is a community-driven project aiming to bring back one of the best versions of Sail VR. We are creating a modified APK and PC client that adds new cheat options, restores classic features, and supports full cross-play, allowing players to connect and play with Sail’s official servers while enjoying enhanced gameplay.

# This project

This project is developed collaboratively by members of the ND community, with ongoing improvements, stability fixes, and new features added over time.

# Features (Planned / In Development)

Cross-play support – Play seamlessly with others on Sail’s servers.

Cheat/mod enhancements – A variety of options to modify gameplay for fun or testing purposes.

Ban system – A custom anti-cheat and ban management system to keep the environment fair for everyone.

Classic Sail VR restoration – Bring back beloved features from older versions including old maps.

PC + VR compatibility – Works both on Android (APK) and PC builds.

Community-driven updates – We will have continuous fixes, optimizations, and feature additions based on feedback sail vr is a small game by a small group of devs so they cant fix as much so we strive to have lots of fixes to our version.

Optional experimental features (future updates) –

Advanced movement options

Expanded VR settings

Quick-load maps or servers

More Inquisitor roles and opportunities

# Ban System

We are developing our own ban system to manage abuse and ensure fair play. This repo will be updated continuously as the APK and PC clients evolve.

This project is semi-open-source:

You may fix bugs or improve features, but do not copy or claim the code as your own.

# Purpose

The goal of Sail.13-APK is to provide coders and VR enthusiasts with a way to explore and enjoy Sail VR outside the official game, while fully supporting the official Sail VR community.
