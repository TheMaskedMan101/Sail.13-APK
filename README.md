# Sail.13-APK

This project aims to bring back one of the best versions of Sail VR by creating a modified APK that supports cheats, restored features, and full cross‑play. Our goal is to make this classic version playable again while still being able to connect to Sail’s servers.

The APK and PC file is being developed collaboratively by me and several contributors from the ND community.
Expect ongoing improvements, new cheat options, stability fixes, and expanded compatibility as the project evolves.
