# 🚀 **Beyond Sail**

**Beyond Sail** is a community-driven project focused on reviving and enhancing one of the best eras of **Sail VR**.  
We provide a modified **APK** and **PC client** that brings back classic features, adds new options like singleplayer mods, restores older mechanics, and supports **full cross-play** with our official community servers.

Enjoy an expanded, restored, and more flexible version of Sail VR — built by the community, for the community.

  - If you do *not* own the game, you will be banned until you do

### 💡 Our Intentions
Beyond does **not** aim to:

- Enable cheating in official servers  

We fully support the official Sail VR developers and encourage users to do the same.
