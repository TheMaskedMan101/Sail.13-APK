# Beyond Sail

Beyond Sail is a community-driven project aiming to bring back one of the best versions of Sail VR. We are creating a modified APK and PC client that adds new options such as singleplayer mods. Beyond restores classic features, and supports full cross-play, allowing players to connect and play with Sail’s official servers while enjoying enhanced gameplay.


# This Project

Beyond is developed collaboratively by members of the ND community, with ongoing improvements, stability fixes, and new features added continuously. Our goal is to maintain a polished, playable experience while expanding functionality beyond the official Sail VR client.

Features (Planned / In Development)

Cross-play support – Play seamlessly with others on our own servers.

Cheat/Mod enhancements – A variety of gameplay modifications for fun or testing purposes.

Ban system – Custom anti-cheat and ban management to ensure fair play.

Classic Sail VR restoration – Bring back beloved features from older versions, including maps and game mechanics.

PC + VR compatibility – Works on both Android (APK) and PC builds.

Community-driven updates – Continuous fixes, optimizations, and feature additions based on community feedback. Sail VR is a small game by a small group of developers, so we aim to provide more consistent updates.

Optional Experimental Features (Future Updates):

Advanced movement options

Expanded VR settings

Quick-load maps or servers

Additional Inquisitor roles and gameplay opportunities

# Ban System

We are developing our own ban system to manage abuse and ensure fair play. This repository will be updated continuously as the APK and PC clients evolve.

# License & Contributions

Beyond is semi-open-source:

You may fix bugs or improve features, but do not copy or claim the code as your own.

Modifications or fixes should be shared with the community, preferably through our Discord server.

Always respect the original authorship and contributions of the ND community.

# Purpose

The goal of Beyond is to provide coders and VR enthusiasts with a way to explore and enjoy Sail VR outside the official client, while still supporting the official Sail VR community.

We are not affiliated with the official Sail VR developers and encourage users to respect the official game’s rules and servers.

Use Beyond responsibly and at your own risk. We are not responsible for any bans, account issues, or other consequences from using modified clients.

Legal Disclaimer & Intentions

You Must Own Sail On Steam To Play This

if you do not own the Sail vr steam files you will be banned until you do 

this is to insure the devs are suported but if you own the apk of beyond it is fine 

We respect the intellectual property of Sail VR. Beyond is not intended to infringe copyrights, monetize the game, or mislead users. Our goals are strictly:

Educational and experimental purposes – For coders, VR enthusiasts, and modders to explore and learn.

Community enjoyment – Providing tools for personal testing and fun outside the official Sail VR client.

Supporting the official game – We encourage players to continue playing and respecting Sail VR’s official servers and guidelines.

By using Beyond, you agree to act responsibly. Modifications are intended only for personal, educational, or research purposes. We do not condone harassment, cheating in official competitive environments, or violating Sail VR’s terms of service.

Note: Any in-game currency purchased in the official Sail VR game will appear at a reduced amount in Beyond. This ensures balance and differentiates our client from the official game.
